# Exploring three js

Three js is a fantastic library which I want to learn along with react three fiber. 

Each branch of this repo will be named after the concept I'm exploring in the section.

There is lack of tutorials on three js online besides few bits and pieces of info in some videos and posts that hardly explain whats happening. 

As a result I'm creating this repository to help me learn and document the journey along the way.

This repo will evolve from three js to react three fiber as I continue to learn. 

Taking inspirations along the way from https://threejs.org/ and https://bruno-simon.com/

Chapters:-
- The cube- three js 
- Line in three js
- Debug in three js
