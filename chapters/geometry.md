## Geometry
Geometries are used to create and define shapes in Three.js. Three.js has many types of built-in geometries, both 2D and 3D.

In this chapter, we'll discuss basic built-in geometries. We’ll first look at the 2D geometries, and after that, we’ll explore all the basic 3D geometries that are available.

1. Plane Geometry
The THREE.PlaneGeometry creates a simple 2D rectangle.

2. Circle Geometry
The THREE.CircleGeometry creates a simple 2D circle.

3. Ring Geometry
The THREE.RingGeometry creates a D disc with a hole in the center.

4. Box Geometry
The THREE.BoxGeometry creates a simple 3D box with specified dimensions.

5. Sphere Geometry
The THREE.SphereGeometry creates 3D sphere geometries.

6. Cylinder Geometry
To create a cylinder in Three.js, you can use the Three.CylinderGeometry.

7. Cone Geometry
You can use THREE.ConeGeometry to create a cone. It is very similar to CylinderGeometry, except it only allows you to set the radius instead of radiusTop and radiusBottom.

8. Torus Geometry
Torus is a tube-like shape that looks like a donut. You can use THREE.TorusGeometry to create a torus in Three.js.

9. TorusKnot Geometry
A torus knot is a special kind of knot that looks like a tube that winds around itself a couple of times.

10. Polyhedron Geometry
A polyhedron is a geometry that has only flat faces and straight edges.
